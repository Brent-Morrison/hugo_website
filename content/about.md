## Purpose

This site will be used to document projects and analysis using R, Python & PostgreSQL, and other Continuing Professional Development activities.  

I catalogue smaller reference type notes at a separate site, my [Reference Library](https://brent-morrison.github.io/ref-library/index.html).  

Thanks for reading!
