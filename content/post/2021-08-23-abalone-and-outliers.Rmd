That title deserves an explanation.

This note will look at the Theil Sen estimator for robust regression. I'm going to use the UCI Machine Learning abalone data set to compare this technique with Ordinary Least Squares.

This one is via a Colab notebook, all is explained [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Brent-Morrison/Misc_scripts/blob/master/theil_sen.ipynb).
