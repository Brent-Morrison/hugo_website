<div id="whats-a-stock-master" class="section level2">
<h2>What’s a stock master?</h2>
<p>It’s database, that contains data on stocks. It is also the master or authoritative, at least for me, source of that data. What kind of data exactly? Prices and fundamentals (and <em>maybe</em> economic time series).</p>
<p>This post is going to document the data sources and tools used in building this database. The repo for the project is <a href="https://github.com/Brent-Morrison/Stock_master">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="motivation" class="section level2">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Firstly, why do I need a database that containing this type of information?</p>
<p>A couple of my earlier posts alluded to the fact that I have an interest in modeling stock prices. For that I require clean data in a consistent format. Grabbing data ad-hoc from the internet doesn’t cut it for my use case. While downloading a couple of tickers on the fly works for a blog post or proof of concept, it won’t cut it for serious analysis. I need a persistent storage, from which I can quickly grab data for analysis using say, R or Python.</p>
<p>Secondly, acquired data will need to be transformed. One such transformation is that of the frequency of the data. Different sources of data are collected at differing periodicity. Price data has a daily periodicity, fundamental quarterly and economic time series monthly. Analysis will be performed monthly. Transformations will also take as inputs relations between stocks in the cross section. Which stocks are in the top decile of ROA, the bottom prior 3 month return quintile, for example. Not something easily done with data stored across hundreds of csv’s<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="specific-requirements" class="section level2">
<h2>Specific requirements</h2>
<div id="breadth-of-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Breadth of data</h3>
<p>I will need data on many stocks. The analysis I plan on doing will look at how stocks behave in the cross section. I’ll be looking to answer questions such as, do undervalued stocks outperform when the economy improves? This means having data on a thousand or so stocks. Why so many? It is only after comparing valuation (or any other metric) across a large sample that the concept of under or over valuation can be estimated. This means defining a universe of stocks and finding a way to acquire and store data efficiently at scale.</p>
</div>
<div id="cleansing" class="section level3">
<h3>Cleansing</h3>
<p>I’m under no illusions that the raw data landed into the database will initially be in a usable format. Post acquisition, a validation and cleaning process will need to be employed before any of the transforms I mention above are performed.</p>
</div>
<div id="automated" class="section level3">
<h3>Automated</h3>
<p>Lastly, I don’t want to be spending hours updating my database with new data. The fun is in the analysis, not the data acquisition. The process of ingesting data should be pain free and repeatable.</p>
<p>In summary I want a ready source of clean data that is updated easily, and that is in a format suitable for further analysis.</p>
<p>In what follows, I will document the sources of data and how that data is captured and initially verified. We will look at the database data model, and I’ll also outline some of the issues encountered along the way.</p>
<p>Let’s get started with the data.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="data-sources" class="section level2">
<h2>Data sources</h2>
<p>Fundamental data is sourced from the <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> (“SEC”) website. Price data is from the <strong>Alpha Vantage</strong> API.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<div id="fundamental-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Fundamental data</h3>
<p>All stocks issuing securities to the public in the US are required to file financial statements with the SEC. The SEC stores this data in the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml">EDGAR</a> (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system) database. The SEC (specifically the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis Office) makes this data available in an aggregated format via its <a href="https://www.sec.gov/dera/data/financial-statement-data-sets.html">website</a> each quarter. A zip file is exposed which contains filings for that quarter. The zip contains four text files:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="25%" />
<col width="75%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">File</th>
<th align="left">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left">SUB</td>
<td align="left">Submission data set, includes fields of information pertinent to the submission and the filing entity</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left">NUM</td>
<td align="left">The Number data set includes, for every submission, for each primary financial statement as it is rendered by the SEC Viewer/Previewer, all line item values</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left">TAG</td>
<td align="left">Tag data set; includes defining information about each tag</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left">PRE</td>
<td align="left">Presentation data set; this provides information about how the tags and numbers were presented in the primary financial statements</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The data dictionary is <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/aqfs.pdf">here</a>, and provides much more detail.</p>
<p>That reads like the data is all very orderly and structured. You might think that once this data is landed into a database, analysis would be straightforward. Financial statements are by definition structured in the sense that the underlying data is stored in a general ledger. General ledgers conform to double entry bookkeeping concepts. Surely the SEC enforces some kind of standardisation in the presentation of filings submitted.</p>
<p>Wrong! And that is not an <a href="http://rankandfiled.com/">opinion I hold on my own</a>.</p>
<p>Something as simple as consistently capturing headline balances like cash or shares outstanding can prove very difficult as we will see.</p>
</div>
<div id="price-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Price data</h3>
<p>Fortunately this is a little easier. Alpha Vantage provides a free API for collecting time series of stock market price and volume data. Data is exposed in CSV or JSON format and is written directly to the database.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="tools" class="section level2">
<h2>Tools</h2>
<div id="the-database" class="section level3">
<h3>The database</h3>
<p>I’m using PostgreSQL as the database engine. After all, it is (albeit self proclaimed) <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">the world’s most advanced open source relational database</a>. Other options include open source databases such as MySQL or MariaDB. There are also time series specific databases such as <a href="https://www.timescale.com/">Timescale</a>. They all would have done the job. PostgreSQL seems to have a good community and support, so that it is.</p>
<p>I am using <a href="https://dbeaver.io/">dbeaver</a> to work with the database.</p>
</div>
<div id="back1" class="section level3">
<h3>Data acquisition</h3>
<p>I’m using Python to grab the data described above. The “modis operandi” is to read the required data into a data frame, reshape if required, connect to the database, and then write to the database. This is of course performed in a loop to allow multiple quarters (in the case of the SEC data), and multiple stocks to be loaded at once. I’m using the standard libraries you’d expect for these types of operations. <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a>, <a href="https://www.psycopg.org/">psycopg2</a>, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> and <a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/">Requests</a>. The work flow sounds fairly simple and straightforward, however a lot of development went in to making this work. What follows is a non exhaustive list of issues / challenges encountered:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The SEC data is held out to be UTF-8 encoded. Non UTF-8 characters are found in the PRE file, this necessitates building logic to select the correct encoding</p></li>
<li><p>Opening a zip file is not quiet as easy as <code>read_csv()</code>. Time to get familiar with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html">io</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html">zipfile</a> modules</p></li>
<li><p>Writing to a database with pandas <code>to_sql</code> is very convenient but also very slow. I will be looking to replace this with psycopg2’s <code>copy_from</code> function, saving the data frame as a csv in memory and then writing to the database</p></li>
<li><p>Alpha Vantage gives us the option of various download types, full or compact versions. These need to be selected dependent on whether a stock has had a split since last updated</p></li>
<li><p>The Alpha Vantage (free version) API has download restrictions. Maximum API calls per minute and per day. Rules have been included to limit calls based on these restrictions</p></li>
<li><p>Encoding logic to grab new data only. This entails getting the date of the most recent records in the database, and determining how much data needs to sourced and written to the database</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Quite a bit going on. Keep in mind that starting out, I lot of these tools were new to me. Some of the issues I have encountered are reflective of a steep learning curve. All the same, this can be a messy process and it takes time to make it work.</p>
<p>The script pulling this data is copied <a href="#sec_script">below</a>.</p>

<div id="data-cleaning" class="section level2">
<h2>Data cleaning</h2>
<div id="fundamental-data-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Fundamental data</h3>
<p>The SEC data is in a long format whereby the key to the <code>NUM</code> file is date, company id and financial statement line item. Pretty much every balance on the financial statements is present. As I said above, those balances are not necessarily standardised. A lot are not required and sometime they are missing. We therefore need to map records to a standardised template. We also need to ensure the integrity of balances returned (a balance sheet needs to balance).</p>
<p>Lets look at those two things in turn.</p>
<div id="mapping-line-items-to-a-standardised-template" class="section level4">
<h4>Mapping line items to a standardised template</h4>
<p>The concept here is simple. A reference table has been created which maps financial statement line items to standardised categories.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>For example, some filers label cash balances <code>CashEquivalentsAtCarryingValue</code>, others <code>CashAndCashEquivalentsAtCarryingValue</code>. Both of these map to cash and this process works for the most part. It can be problematic however when tags overlap. For example one filer may disclose both <code>TotalCash</code> and <code>TotalCashandEquivalents</code> (lets call it Company A), and another only <code>TotalCash</code> (Company B). Both of these tags need to map into cash but which to choose? If you sum these records Company A will be overstated, a component of the total will be added to the total. If you exclude <code>TotalCash</code> from the mapping , Company B will have no cash balances mapped to the standardised template. I have taken the record containing the largest balance to get around this problem. Other types of balances require taking the minimum. To add to the complexity, the use of maximum or minimum may be dependent on other rules and constraints. See below.</p>
</div>
<div id="back2" class="section level4">
<h4>Ensuring integrity of accounting information</h4>
<p>A balance sheet needs to balance. Net income implicit in the movement of retained earnings during a period must agree to the income statement. The components of a summary balance (current assets for example) must sum to that summary balance. There are many other “accounting identities” that when violated indicate bad data. These represent constraints on certain balances, and these constraints can be used as rules for determining appropriate balances when data is missing or inconsistent. There exists a hierarchy to these accounting identities corresponding to the granularity at which financial statements are presented. For example at the highest level, assets equals liabilities plus equity. At a lower level, the goodwill amortisation charge in the income statement should correspond to the movement in accumulated amortisation in the balance sheet. The level at which a constraint is defined is important for the order in which we assess it.</p>
<p>OK, that’s all fine and good. What is the impact on how we actually check integrity and implement transformations if required?</p>
<p>To start with, what we don’t do is aggregate low level balances to determine summary or total balances. This does not work due to the variation in labels discussed above.</p>
<p>Rather, accounting identities are checked at the highest aggregation level, and then only once this has been verified are balances at the next lowest level of granularity considered. We peel back the onion so to speak. Lock in what we know to be true, and then dig deeper. It is much more likely that higher level balances like total equity are present and correct, than lower level balances like receivables.</p>
<p>To put that in real terms, imagine a case with no total assets returned (some companies will present current assets and non-current assets but not total assets). We therefore look at total equity and total liabilities to infer total assets. The next round of verification is at a lower level of granularity, and it is then that current assets and non-current assets are summed to check against total assets.</p>
<p>This process is implemented in a view which is quiet the monster, I’ve included it <a href="#sec_view">below</a> to get a flavour of what is required here. The never ending series of CTE’s is checking if internal consistency is satisfied, if not, finding the missing balance, and then choosing the method to infer what is missing.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="price-data-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Price data</h3>
<p>No cleaning is performed on price data. It is hard to know if something is not right without the reference points accounting identities provide. It is worth pointing out the update method. Data is appended when historical prices change due to dividends or splits. Most applications would overwrite historical data in this scenario. I choose not to do this. I want to make sure I don’t lose data should Alpha Vantage ever decide to provide less than 20 years of history. This requires that when querying price, only the most recent acquisition data is retrieved so that multiple records relating to the same date are not returned.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="data-model" class="section level2">
<h2>Data model</h2>
<p>The database can be characterised as an analytic database, ingesting raw data requiring transformation.</p>
<p>The data I am storing comes in different grains, relating to the frequency of that data. Stock prices are daily. Fundamental data is quarterly. Reference data (stock symbols, stock names, universe membership, etc) is slowly changing.</p>
<p>Analysis will be preformed at a monthly frequency.</p>
<p>For these reason the standard analytic architecture of acquisition layer, integration / modeling layer and access layer make sense. What has been discussed thus far is the acquisition process and some components of the integration / modeling layer. Further modeling takes place creating attributes to be used in forecasting returns. These attributes are created using transformations such as residuals from cross sectional regression (to assess valuation), and rolling return and volatility estimation. Other techniques will be used too. Due to the complexity of these types of transformations they are performed in R and Python. I’m not going to cover this now, but point out that this extra layer of modeling occurs before data is written to fact tables in the access layer. Documentation of these processes can wait until another post.</p>
</div>
<div id="planned-functionality" class="section level2">
<h2>Planned functionality</h2>
<p>This thing will be ever evolving. The immediate plans for additional functionality relate to manual overlays. The idea here is to allow input of missing data. For example, a common issue is share count data missing or incorrectly quoted (we see counts quoted in both millions and thousands). Building logic to capture and correct this can be tricky. It is easier to manually capture and insert as an overlay to the raw SEC data.</p>
</div>
<div id="wrapping-up" class="section level2">
<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>So that gives a brief outline of how I’m loading data into the acquisition layer of my database. We also covered some of the initial standardisation and integration steps. The next step is transforming that data into features that will ultimately be used for predictive modeling.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Brent-Morrison/Stock_master">repo</a> has further details on the project.</p>
<p>This post is a little light on visualisation and code. To showcase the data collected I’ll finish up with a couple of plots. One using the price data and one the fundamental data. The first looks at the <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w14804">skewness effect</a> and the next, the relation between return on assets and future returns. These are taking data directly from the database.</p>
